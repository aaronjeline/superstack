# Super-Stack

I was upset with Substack's performance on MacOS safari, so here's a little script to pull down the raw styling for a given article

Usage:
If you've got `uv`:
```
./superstack.py <public substack url>
```

If not, install `httpx` and BeautifulSoup 4, and 
```
python ./superstack.py <public substack url>
```
